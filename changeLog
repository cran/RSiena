2013-06-18 R-forge revision 232
Changes in RSiena:
   * Drop the possibility to use obsolete package snow and rlecuyer
     if Rversion < 2.14.0; functionality replaced by
     package parallel (siena07.r).
   * Correct DESCRIPTION file to satisfy CRAN requirements.
   * Correct lines in various help pages that were too long
     in the pdf version.

2013-06-15 R-forge revision 231
Changes in RSiena as well as RSienaTest:
   * Make the "cumulative" option operational in BehaviorDistribution()
     (sienaGOF.r).
   * Correct bug in treatment of missing values in sparseMatrixExtraction()
     (sienaGOF.r).
   * Allow sparse observed data matrices, and structural zeros and ones, in
     sparseMatrixExtraction() and networkExtraction(),
     and bipartite networks in networkExtraction() (sienaGOF.r).
   * In case prevAns exists, recalculate z$dinvv instead of taking it
     from prevAns (initializeFRAN.r) (parameter diag may have changed)
   * Report correct centering (by overall means) of individual
     covariates for multi-group objects (print01Report.r).
   * in sienaTimeTest: string in toTest$effectName set to "chisq="
     instead of "p=" (sienaTimeTest.r)
   * In print method for sienaAlgorithm, report of conditional corrected
     in case !x$cconditional (sienaprint.r)
   * If there is a composition change object, MoM estimation is forced
     to be non-conditional (initializeFRAN.r). This is reported in the help file
     (sienaCompositionChange.Rd).     
   * Small changes in help files sienaAlgorithm.Rd, plot.sienaTimeTest.Rd,


2013-05-10 R-forge revision 230

	  \pkg\RSiena\src\model\variables\DiffusionEffectValueTable.h
	  \pkg\RSiena\man\sienaGOF-auxiliary.Rd

	  \pkg\RSiena\inst\doc\effects.pdf
	  was updated.

2013-04-19 R-forge revision 227
Changes in RSiena as well as RSienaTest;
both now are very similar; sienaBayes, algorithms, and profileLikelihoods
are the only functions in RSienaTest not in RSiena.
Available effects now are the same.

I hope the list of changes indicated here is complete.

For Siena only:
	* function bayes() was removed (still under development in RSienaTest).
	* Attributes "allowOnly" and "simOnly" ported from RSienaTest.
	* Improved error messages in  includeEffects ported from RSienaTest.
	* sienaGOF ported from RSienaTest.
	* siena.table() ported from RSienaTest, in file sienatable.r.
	* Changes of revision 226 ported from RSienaTest.

For RSienaTest only:
	* bayes() renamed to sienaBayes() and considerably changed.
	* Added function print.sienaBayesFit to sienaprint.r, with
		new documentation file printsienaBayesFit.Rd.
	* Some invisible developments for settings model.

For RSiena and RSienaTest:
	* Changes to sienaGOF: new use structure with auxiliary functions
		sparseMatrixExtraction, networkExtraction, behaviorExtraction,
		allowing to test any dependent variable;
		commented out some superfluous lines.
	* The function sienaModelCreate() is now called sienaAlgorithmCreate(),
		but the earlier name is still retained as an alias;
		the class name of the object created by this function is now called
		sienaAlgorithm.
	* The function sienaNet() is now called sienaDependent(),
		but the earlier name is still retained as an alias;
		the class name of the object created by this function is now
		sienaDependent.
	* The function effectsDocumentation() now has an extra argument "effects";
		if this points to an effects object, all available effects
		in this effects object are listed with shortName,
		with a variety of other often used characteristics.
	* Effect type "covarBehaviorOneModeRate" was added.
	* Added effects (some existed already in RSienaTest):
		average exposure effect on rate xxxxxx, avExposure
		susceptibility to av. exp. by indegree effect on rate xxxxxx,
			susceptAvIn
		total exposure effect on rate xxxxxx, totExposure,
		infection by indegree effect on rate xxxxxx, infectIn,
		infection by outdegree effect on rate xxxxxx,  infectOut,
		susceptibility to av. exp. by zzzzzz effect on rate xxxxxx,
			susceptAvCovar
		infection by zzzzzz effect on rate xxxxxx, infectCovar,
		WW=>X cyclic closure of xxxxxx, cyWWX
		WW=>X shared incoming xxxxxx, InWWX
		WW=>X shared outgoing xxxxxx, OutWWX
		xxxxxx alter at distance 2 (#), altDist2
		xxxxxx similarity at distance 2, simDist2
		transitive triplets xxxxxx similarity, simXTransTrip
		transitive triplets same xxxxxx, sameXTransTrip
		transitive triplets jumping xxxxxx, jumpXTransTrip
		transitive reciprocated triplets, transRecTrip
		GWESP I -> K -> J (#), gwespFF
		GWESP I <- K <- J (#), gwespBB
		GWESP I <- K -> J (#), gwespFB
		GWESP I -> K <- J (#), gwespBF
		GWESP I <> K <> J (#), gwespRR
		isolate - popularity, isolatePop
		in-isolate Outdegree, inIsDegree
		network-isolate, isolateNet
		outdegree^(1/#) xxxxxx popularity, outPopIntn xxxxxx
		closure jumping yyyyyy, jumpWWClosure
		mixed xxxxxx closure jumping yyyyyy, jumpWXClosure
		cyclic closure of xxxxxx, cyClosure
		shared incoming xxxxxx, sharedIn
	* Outdegree-popularity effect: multiplication by n dropped.
	* GWESP effects: default parameter changed from 25 to 69
		(corresponding to alpha = log(2).) See the manual.
	* Added to siena07:
		option "Dolby" for variance reduction.
		Correlations between scores and statistics are reported in output file;
		this is a measure for the amount of variance reduction.
	* Added to siena07:
		option "diagonalize" for having more possibilities for
		tuning the algorithm
		(extent of diagonalization of matrix D in Robbins-Monro update).
	* sienaTimeTest() updated; now also contains effect-wise tests,
		groupwise tests (for group objects), automatic exclusion of
		collinear effects, and has prettier output and improved	summary.
	* Truncation of update steps in phase2.r modified.
	* Overall maximum convergence ratio, x$tconv.max
		(maximum value of t-ratio for convergence, for any linear combination)
		added to result of siena07.
	* The print method for objects of class siena (created by sienaDataCreate)
		has been extended with printing "uponly" and "downly" attributes,
		if these are TRUE.
	* A bug in the starting values for two-mode networks was corrected.
	* Small bug fixed in print01Report() for reporting of uponly and downonly,
		in the case where this does not affect all periods.
	* Changed almost all .Rd documentation files: sometimes to make them
		better understandable or complete, sometimes to make more appropriate 
		examples, sometimes only minor prettifications.
	* Updated:
		pkg\RSiena(Test)\inst\scripts\Rscript01DataFormat.R, 
	 	pkg\RSiena(Test)\inst\scripts\Rscript02VariableFormat.R,
 	 	pkg\RSiena(Test)\inst\scripts\Rscript03SienaRunModel.R,
 	 	pkg\RSiena(Test)\inst\scripts\Rscript04SienaBehaviour.R.
		(of pkg\RSiena(Test)\inst\scripts\RSienaDescriptives
		 only the date was changed.)
 	* Updated tests\scriptfile.Rout.win to current version
		(scriptfile.Rout.save).
	* Manual and siena.bib updated.

	* R/sienaGOF.r: removed dependency on snopgof (runs standalone)
	  and a number of smaller features like being able to run a
	  joint test across all waves or break them out, having control
	  over the centrality measure (mean, median, etc.), and not
	  requiring that the auxiliary statistics are non-collinear
	  (this is where MASS's ginv comes in). I also moved the
	  relevant functionality from snopgof directly into the code.

	* R/phase1.3, R/phase3.r: Created subroutine to calculate
	derivative matrix
	* R/effects.r: corrected possible bug in creation of effects data
	frame for multigroup projects.
	* R/effects.r: corrected bug in creation of effects data
	frame for changing covariates.
        * R/siena07.r: added effect numbers to the Estimation screen and
	rationalised the display routines.
        * R/sienaTest.r: altered function interface so can call the
	scoreTest function from outside siena07 context. Corrected a
	missing change of sign for onesided test values.
	* R/sienaPrint.r: print methods now return their argument
	invisibly
	* src/siena07.cpp: altered flag for return of simulated dependent
	variables.

	* R/siena01.r new option to edit effects split by dependent
	variable. Only partially functioning...

2009-11-08 R-forge revision 21

	* src/model/variables/BehaviorVariable.cpp,
	src/model/variables/BehaviorVariable.h: Uninitialised data in scores
	causing NaN's in derivative.

2009-11-05 R-forge revision 20

	* man/siena07.Rd: added detail to return value description
	* src/siena07.cpp: added functionalilty for user-specified
	interactions

2009-11-04 R-forge revision 19

	* R/phase1.r, R/phase2.r, R/phase3.r, R/simstatsc.r; corrected
	finDiff.method flag

2009-10-31 R-forge revision 18

	* src/model/tables/NetWorkCache.cpp, etc: New files added

	* DESCRIPTION, man/RSiena.RD: version Number 1.0.6
	* NAMESPACE, DESCRIPTION, R/sienaPrint.r : xtable method
	* R/phase1.r, R/phase2.r, R/phase3.r: stopped using ... in call to
	FRAN, which restored speed gain of multiple processors.
	* data/allEffects.R, data/alleffects.csv, R/effects.r: new R effects
	system
	* tests: directory added
	* R/sienaDataCreate.r, R/effects.r, R/printDataReport.r,
	R/simstatsc.r, R/sienaDataCreateFromSession.r, R/print01Report.r,
	R/printInitialDescription: bipartite nets
	* src/data, src/model, src/network, src/utils, src/siena07.cpp:
	new C++ effects system
	* src/model/statisticCalculator.cpp: structural zeros code
	corrected
	* src/model/EpochSimulation.cpp: revert to proper random number
	generator unless parallel running.
